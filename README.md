Admin Dashboard

Requirements
- Replicate design file
- Already practiced using flex, Encouraged to use grid as much as possible for practice

Project History
- Researched CSS naming conventions https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/
- Researched when to use a id or class. Id is for unique elements, class is for repeat elements
- For some reason one grid was not enough to make the your-projects, announcements, trending layout. I had to make two. Wondering if there is a grid setting I'm missing
